/// `SliderPickerTheme` provides comprehensive styling options for slider pickers,
/// including colors, sizing, and animations for smooth interactions.
///
/// ## Basic Usage
///
/// ```swift
/// let customTheme = SliderPickerTheme(
///     color: .purple,
///     backgroundColor: .gray.opacity(0.2),
///     height: 40,
///     cornerRadius: 20
/// )
///
/// SliderPicker(selection: $value, steps: 10)
///     .environment(\.sliderPickerTheme, customTheme)
/// ```
///
/// ## Multiple Pickers with Different Themes
///
/// ```swift
/// VStack {
///     SliderPicker(selection: $value1, steps: 10)
///         .environment(\.sliderPickerTheme, SliderPickerTheme(color: .green))
///
///     SliderPicker(selection: $value2, steps: 10)
///         .environment(\.sliderPickerTheme, SliderPickerTheme(color: .orange))
/// }
/// ```
///
